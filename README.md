# EMEA SA2 Training

This is a set of labs that will probably take an afternoon, but if you do not 
finish them all within the afternoon you may continue at home. 

There are two options for running the labs, either on **OpenStack**, or on your 
**laptop**. While running them on your local laptop may seem appealing, **running them
on OpenStack will generally be less effort and will be faster**. 

## Order that the labs should be delivered:

1. [Deploy Atomic Hosts](deployAtomicHosts.md)
1. [Atomic LVM Storage](atomicDockerLVM.md)
1. [SPC Images / Containers](spcContainers.md)
1. [Configure Flannel](configFlannel.md)
1. [Configure Kubernetes](configKubernetes.md)
